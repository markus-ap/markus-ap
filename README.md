## About me
By day I work as a consultant at [Bouvet](https://github.com/bouvet) where I specialise as a [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) backender. 
<sup><sup>Psst!</sup>Don't tell anyone that I'd never touched .NET until 2021 👀</sup>

I design APIs to help streamline a semantic data pipeline. Yes.

If you go digging in my public repositories be warned that they are most (if not all) in Norwegian. Code structure, branches, commit logs, everything.
It is enough to strike fear into any programming Norwegian. Which is my primary drive for doing so.

## Hobby Projects
I don't have too many public repositories with projects, but my current hobby projects involve [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)), [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework),
and [veganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism). 🌱

I embarrassingly recently had the epiphany that I am capabale of creating apps, so I am also experimenting with automatic pipelines to [Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure).

Any results or publications of hobby projects will be listed here:

  - The start of a public messaging platform / API

## My programming history
My very first programming language was [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). I was making a basic website when a desire to open a link in a new window 
sent me down a rabbit hole I've never quite dug myself out of. 🕳

However, it would be quite a few more years before I dipped my toes back into the realm of programming. I got a bachelor's of arts in computer character animation from 
[Teesside University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teesside_University) which landed me my first proper job as a ✨techinical designer✨. <sup>I rendered 3D-
models, and designed powerpoint presentations.</sup>

One day I thought to myself:
> Markus 🙋 Why are you doing these same steps every day? Don't you think this could be automated?

Turns out that, yes! Yes, it could. ✅

Enter [MAXScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_3ds_Max#Features), the scripting language for [Autodesk 3Ds Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_3ds_Max).

All of a sudden I had automated my most tedious tasks and made new plug-ins to be used by me and my colleagues work. 👨‍💻

I even started getting new tasks for my newfound skills. I started using [Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)) to create small applications.
I started off with [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) again, but quickly discovered that [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) was the way to go.
I just started to get comfortable with it when I got downsized, and knocked back to school. 🏫

This time I went straight for information science where I started off with learning [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)); got re-introduced
to [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript); and eventually started learning [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). 

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) quickly became my go-to language when I wanted to try something, and still is to this day. Even when my days are filled with [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) at work.

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), my first love. 💚
